Note that data from a participant or a specific trial can be invalid due to more than one reason. We removed task trials with incorrect (8.13%) or missing (2.35%) responses, task trials with extremely fast (RT < 100, 0.22%) or slow RTs (RT > 750, 0.7%). Next we removed the data from a total of 22 participants (10.58% out of 208) where their accuracy on task trials was below < 80% (N = 21), or where less than 80% of the trials were valid in terms of either RT, accuracy or both (N = 22). In total, 17.75% of the task trials were removed, by filtering whole participants' data or individual trials. Note that out of the clean data, we select only trials which immediately follow a correct-response task trial.
