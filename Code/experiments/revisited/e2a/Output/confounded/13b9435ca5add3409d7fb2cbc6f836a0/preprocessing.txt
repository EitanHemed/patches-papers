The amounts specified below refer only to the portion of task trials, excluding all probe trials (16.6% of raw data). Note that data from a participant or a specific trial can be invalid due to more than one reason. We removed task trials with incorrect (7.27%) or missing (0.30%) responses, task trials with extremely fast (RT < 100, 0.09%) or slow RTs (RT > 750, 0.55%). Next we removed the data from a total of 2 participants (2.50% out of 80) where their accuracy on task trials was below < 80% (N = 1), accuracy on attentional probe trials was below < 50% (N = 0), or where less than 80% of the trials were valid in terms of either RT, accuracy or both (N = 1). In total, 9.99% of the task trials were removed, by filtering whole participants' data or individual trials.
