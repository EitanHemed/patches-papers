Note that data from a participant or a specific trial can be invalid due to more than one reason. We removed task trials with incorrect (7.34%) or missing (5.12%) responses, task trials with extremely fast (RT < 100, 0.29%) or slow RTs (RT > 750, 1.01%). Next we removed the data from a total of 17 participants (15.18% out of 112) where their accuracy on task trials was below < 80% (N = 15), or where less than 80% of the trials were valid in terms of either RT, accuracy or both (N = 17). In total, 22.10% of the task trials were removed, by filtering whole participants' data or individual trials. Note that out of the clean data, we select only trials which immediately follow a correct-response task trial.
