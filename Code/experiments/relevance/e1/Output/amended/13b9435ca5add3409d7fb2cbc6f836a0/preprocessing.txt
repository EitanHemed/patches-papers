The amounts specified below refer only to the portion of task trials, excluding all probe trials (16.6% of raw data). Note that data from a participant or a specific trial can be invalid due to more than one reason. We removed task trials with incorrect (8.64%) or missing (0.98%) responses, task trials with extremely fast (RT < 100, 0.37%) or slow RTs (RT > 750, 1.38%). Next we removed the data from a total of 24 participants (9.49% out of 253) where their accuracy on task trials was below < 80% (N = 15), accuracy on attentional probe trials was below < 50% (N = 5), or where less than 80% of the trials were valid in terms of either RT, accuracy or both (N = 22). In total, 16.67% of the task trials were removed, by filtering whole participants' data or individual trials.
