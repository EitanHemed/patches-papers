The amounts specified below refer only to the portion of task trials, excluding all probe trials (16.6% of raw data). Note that data from a participant or a specific trial can be invalid due to more than one reason. We removed task trials with incorrect (8.89%) or missing (1.00%) responses, task trials with extremely fast (RT < 100, 0.51%) or slow RTs (RT > 750, 1.94%). Next we removed the data from a total of 33 participants (10.71% out of 308) where their accuracy on task trials was below < 80% (N = 20), accuracy on attentional probe trials was below < 50% (N = 5), or where less than 80% of the trials were valid in terms of either RT, accuracy or both (N = 31). In total, 18.04% of the task trials were removed, by filtering whole participants' data or individual trials.
